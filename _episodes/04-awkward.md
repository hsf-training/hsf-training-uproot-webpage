# What is Awkward Array?

The previous lesson included a tricky slice:

~~~
cut = (muons["nMuon"] == 2)

pt0 = muons["Muon_pt", cut, 0]
~~~
{: .language-python}

The three parts of `muons["Muon_pt", cut, 0]` slice

1. selects the `"Muon_pt"` field of all records in the array,
2. applies `cut`, a boolean array, to select only events with two muons,
3. selects the first (`0`) muon from each of those pairs. Similarly for the second (`1`) muons.

NumPy would not be able to perform such a slice, or even represent an array of variable-length lists without resorting to arrays of objects.

~~~
import numpy as np
np.array([[0.0, 1.1, 2.2], [], [3.3, 4.4], [5.5], [6.6, 7.7, 8.8, 9.9]])
~~~
{: .language-python}

Awkward Array is intended to fill this gap:

~~~
import awkward as ak
ak.Array([[0.0, 1.1, 2.2], [], [3.3, 4.4], [5.5], [6.6, 7.7, 8.8, 9.9]])
~~~
{: .language-python}

Arrays like this are sometimes called "[jagged arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_array)" and sometimes "ragged arrays."

## Slicing in Awkward Array

Basic slices are a generalization of NumPy'sâ€”what NumPy would do if it had variable-length lists.

~~~
array = ak.Array([[0.0, 1.1, 2.2], [], [3.3, 4.4], [5.5], [6.6, 7.7, 8.8, 9.9]])
array.tolist()

array[2]
array[-1, 1]
array[2:, 0]
array[2:, 1:]
array[:, 0]
~~~
{: .language-python}

**Quick quiz:** why does the last one raise an error?

Boolean and integer slices work, too:

~~~
array[[True, False, True, False, True]]

array[[2, 3, 3, 1]]
~~~
{: .language-python}

Like NumPy, boolean arrays for slices can be computed, and functions like [ak.num](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.num.html) are helpful for that.

~~~
ak.num(array)

ak.num(array) > 0

array[ak.num(array) > 0, 0]
array[ak.num(array) > 1, 1]
~~~
{: .language-python}

Now consider this (similar to an example from the first lesson):

~~~
cut = (array * 10 % 2 == 0)

array[cut]
~~~
{: .language-python}

This array, `cut`, is not just an array of booleans. It's a jagged array of booleans. All of its nested lists fit into `array`'s nested lists, so it can deeply select numbers, rather than selecting lists.

## Application: selecting particles, rather than events

Returning to the big TTree from the previous lesson,

~~~
import uproot
file = uproot.open("root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/derived-data/AOD2NanoAODOutreachTool/Run2012BC_DoubleMuParked_Muons.root")
tree = file["Events"]

muon_pt = tree["Muon_pt"].array(entry_stop=10)
~~~
{: .language-python}

This jagged array of booleans selects all *muons* with at least 20 GeV:

~~~
particle_cut = (muon_pt > 20)

muon_pt[particle_cut]
~~~
{: .language-python}

and this non-jagged array of booleans (made with [ak.any](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.any.html)) selects all events *that have* a muon with at least 20 GeV:

~~~
event_cut = ak.any(muon_pt > 20, axis=1)

muon_pt[event_cut]
~~~
{: .language-python}

**Quick quiz:** construct exactly the same `event_cut` using [ak.max](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.max.html).

**Quick quiz:** apply both cuts; that is, select muons with over 20 GeV from events that have them.

Hint: you'll want to make a

~~~
cleaned = muon_pt[particle_cut]
~~~
{: .language-python}

intermediary and you can't use the variable `event_cut`, as-is.

# Combinatorics in Awkward Array

Variable-length lists present more problems than just slicing and computing formulas array-at-a-time. Often, we want to combine particles in all possible pairs (within each event) to look for decay chains.

## Pairs from two arrays, pairs from a single array

Awkward Array has functions that generate these combinations. For instance, [ak.cartesian](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.cartesian.html) takes a Cartesian product per event (when `axis=1`, the default).

![cartoon-cartesian]({{ page.root }}/fig/cartoon-cartesian.png)

~~~
numbers = ak.Array([[1, 2, 3], [], [5, 7], [11]])
letters = ak.Array([["a", "b"], ["c"], ["d"], ["e", "f"]])

pairs = ak.cartesian((numbers, letters))
~~~
{: .language-python}

These `pairs` are 2-tuples, which are like records in how they're sliced out of an array: using strings.

~~~
pairs["0"]
pairs["1"]
~~~
{: .language-python}

There's also [ak.unzip](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.unzip.html), which extracts every field into a separate array (opposite of [ak.zip](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.zip.html)).

~~~
lefts, rights = ak.unzip(pairs)
lefts
rights
~~~
{: .language-python}

Note that these `lefts` and `rights` are not the original `numbers` and `letters`: they have been duplicated and have the same shape.

The Cartesian product is equivalent to this C++ `for` loop over two collections:

~~~
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < letters.size(); j++) {
    // compute formula with numbers[i] and letters[j]
  }
}
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

Sometimes, though, we want to find all pairs within a single collection, without repetition. That would be equivalent to this C++ `for` loop:

~~~
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
  for (int j = i + 1; i < numbers.size(); j++) {
    // compute formula with numbers[i] and numbers[j]
  }
}
~~~
{: .language-cpp}

The Awkward function for this case is [ak.combinations](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.combinations.html).

![cartoon-combinations]({{ page.root }}/fig/cartoon-combinations.png)

~~~
pairs = ak.combinations(numbers, 2)
pairs

lefts, rights = ak.unzip(pairs)

lefts * rights   # they line up, so we can compute formulas
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Application to dimuons

The dimuon search in the previous lesson was a little naive in that we required *exactly two* muons to exist in every event and only computed the mass of that combination. If a third muon were present because it's a complex electroweak decay or because something was mismeasured, we would be blind to the other two muons. They might be real dimuons.

A better procedure would be to look for all pairs of muons in an event and apply some criteria for selecting them.

In this example, we'll [ak.zip](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.zip.html) the muon variables together into records.

~~~
import uproot

file = uproot.open("root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/derived-data/AOD2NanoAODOutreachTool/Run2012BC_DoubleMuParked_Muons.root")
tree = file["Events"]

arrays = tree.arrays(filter_name="/Muon_(pt|eta|phi|charge)/", entry_stop=10000)

muons = ak.zip({
    "pt": arrays["Muon_pt"],
    "eta": arrays["Muon_eta"],
    "phi": arrays["Muon_phi"],
    "charge": arrays["Muon_charge"],
})

arrays.type
muons.type
~~~
{: .language-python}

The difference between `arrays` and `muons` is that `arrays` contains separate lists of `"Muon_pt"`, `"Muon_eta"`, `"Muon_phi"`, `"Muon_charge"`, while `muons` contains lists of records with `"pt"`, `"eta"`, `"phi"`, `"charge"` fields.

Now we can compute pairs of muon *objects*

~~~
pairs = ak.combinations(muons, 2)

pairs.type
~~~
{: .language-python}

and separate them into arrays of the first muon and the second muon in each pair.

~~~
mu1, mu2 = ak.unzip(pairs)
~~~
{: .language-python}

**Quick quiz:** how would you ensure that all lists of records in `mu1` and `mu2` have the same lengths? Hint: see [ak.num](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.num.html) and [ak.all](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.all.html).

Since they do have the same lengths, we can use them in a formula.

~~~
import numpy as np

mass = np.sqrt(2*mu1.pt*mu2.pt*(np.cosh(mu1.eta - mu2.eta) - np.cos(mu1.phi - mu2.phi)))
~~~
{: .language-python}

**Quick quiz:** how many masses do we have in each event? How does this compare with `muons`, `mu1`, and `mu2`?

## Plotting the jagged array

Since this `mass` is a jagged array, it can't be directly histogrammed. Histograms take a set of *numbers* as inputs, but this array contains *lists*.

Supposing you just want to plot the numbers from the lists, you can use [ak.flatten](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.flatten.html) to flatten one level of list or [ak.ravel](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.ravel.html) to flatten all levels.

~~~
import hist

hist.Hist(hist.axis.Regular(120, 0, 120, label="mass [GeV]")).fill(

    ak.ravel(mass)

).plot()
~~~
{: .language-python}

Alternatively, suppose you want to plot the *maximum* mass-candidate in each event, biasing it toward Z bosons? [ak.max](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.max.html) is a different function that picks one element from each list, when used with `axis=1`.

~~~
ak.max(mass, axis=1)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Some values are `None` because there is no maximum of an empty list. [ak.flatten](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.flatten.html)/[ak.ravel](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.ravel.html) remove missing values (`None`) as well as squashing lists,

~~~
ak.flatten(ak.max(mass, axis=1), axis=0)
~~~
{: .language-python}

but so does removing the empty lists in the first place.

~~~
ak.max(mass[ak.num(mass) > 0], axis=1)
~~~

> > Instead of maximizing `mass`, we want to minimize `abs(mass - zmass)` and apply that choice to `mass`. [ak.argmin](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.argmin.html) returns the *index position* of this minimum difference, which we can then apply to the original `mass`. However, without `keepdims=True`, [ak.argmin](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.argmin.html) removes the dimension we would need for this array to have the same nested shape as `mass`. Therefore, we `keepdims=True` and then use [ak.ravel](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/ak.ravel.html) to get rid of missing values and flatten lists.
